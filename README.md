# iC880A + Raspberry Pi Backplane

This is a backplane to connect an iC880A-SPI concentrator board to a Raspberry
Pi. It is similar to the [backplane by
@gonzalocasas](https://github.com/gonzalocasas/ic880a-backplane), but aims to
give you the following additional features:

- Give you access to the full Raspberry Pi pinout
- Separate pin header for power input (5V/GND)
- Separate pin header for IÂ²C based sensors (SDA/SCL/GND/3.3V/5V)
- Separate pin header for serial communication (RX/TX)

Work in progress.
